# KNN-Algorithm
Applied KNN Algorithm on iris dataset to get accuracy score and error.
Also applied KNN Cross Validation Algorithm to get the generalized acuuracy and error.
Plotted graph for train error and cv error to find the best fit of the model
Implemented K-fold cross validation and also plotted decision surfaces for different k values.
